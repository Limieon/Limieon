# Hi there 👋, I'm Limieon
Hello, I'm Justin Jakob, a 19-year-old software developer.
I started my journey back in the 7th grade by learning how to create Minecraft mods using Java and Forge.  
Currently, I'm mainly working on a StableDiffusion WebUI and experimenting with AI stuff. Later on, I also plan to continue or start over my voxel game engine.

I mostly prefer languages with a C-like syntax and static-typing over dynamic-typing, even though I'm currently using:
* TypeScript
* Python
* C#
* C++

I'm also using the following Libraries/Frameworks:
* PyTorch
* Svelte
* FastAPI
* OpenGL
* DirectX
